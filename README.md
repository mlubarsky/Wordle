This program allows a user to play Wordle with the computer.

The objective of the game is to guess the randomly picked, secret 5 letter word.
To play, first type in a 5 letter word in all lower case. If the word you typed 
in has a matching letter with the secret word, but is not in the same spot as the
letter from the correct word, that letter will pop up lower case. If your letter is 
matching and is in the correct spot, it will pop up upper case. If you don't match a 
letter, there will just be a dash. You have 6 attempts to guess the secret word. 
Guessing the word in 6 attempts or less means you win! If you don't, you lose.
